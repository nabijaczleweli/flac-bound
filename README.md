FLAC encoding via libFLAC FFI

## [Documentation](https://rawcdn.githack.com/nabijaczleweli/flac-bound/doc/flac_bound/index.html)

## Building <!-- also update toplevel doc -->

There are two supported libFLAC back-ends:
  * [`flac-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/flac-sys), under the `"flac"` feature, the default, and
  * [`libflac-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/libflac-sys), under the `"libflac"` feature group.

`flac-sys` tries to link to a libFLAC already present on your system, but it doesn't do a very good job, and might need some help by copying
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libFLAC.so` (Debian), `$MSYSROOT\mingw64\lib\libflac.dll.a` (msys2), or equivalent
to `target/{debug,release}/deps` as `libflac.so`/`libflac.dll.a`/&c. (note the lowercase).

`libflac-sys` tries to build libFLAC; this is a problem because it (a) doesn't work all that well (at all) under GNU/NT,
and (b) requires the host system to have both CMake and a C toolchain funxional.

The `"libflac-noogg"` feature will build libFLAC without OGG support.

The `"libflac-nobuild"` feature will still use `libflac-sys` but instruct it to link to the system libFLAC.

Downstreams are encouraged to expose these features to the user.
